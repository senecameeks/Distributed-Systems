# Tapestry

Hello, to the best of our beliefs, our code is bug-free. We have a multitude of tests, written in a variety of test files, testing the ID functions, and other functions / functionalities for node_core, node_init, routing_table and our Tapestry structure in general.

For some reason, we cannot run this assignment on SSH due to weird git errors saying something about not having specific googleapis packages. So if it does not run at all please let us know ! It really should run.
