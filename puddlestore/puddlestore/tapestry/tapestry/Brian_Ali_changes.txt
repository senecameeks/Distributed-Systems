changes we made:

Sprintfs had to be formatted correctly in cli.go and unknown_routing_table_test.go (didn't have % sign)
Need to import tapestry/tapestry manually in testing and reference as t.RemoteNode, t.ID, etc.
did a go get for gopkg.in/check.v1
did a go get for abiosoftShell (but not specific to this assignment)
changed package for testing to 'tapestry' instead of 'testing'
We moved all of the files from the testing directory to the tapestry directory (should have been like this in the
first place, like Raft/Liteminer)
We added a TestingT function to all of the go check tests so that they would run (potentially this happens on its own)
