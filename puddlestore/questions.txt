Questions for our TA:
- Matt's Questions:
-- for raft do we create a local cluster or just create a bunch of raft nodes make sure they all communicate / how to maintain and make sure they are alive
-- wtf is acl
-- how to reboot zookeeper server -> prob important for testing
-- wtf is wrong w using the built-in locks
-- can we use sequence NOT in the context of locks? like just for raft1 raft2 etc
-- how do we actually replace znode and zab w tapestry and raft?
-- had issue w encoding that said type raft.NetworkPolicy has no exported fields
    understand why this is the case but how much would it fuck up existing raft to
    make some shit exported - as i am assuming that we need to maintain some component of this
      solution: i am gonna make this unexported inside of Raft Node as I think it is
      primarily utilized for testing RAFT -> am gonna do this after asking bc i would have to
      spelling everywhere and thats annoying
-- how tf do we know what version to delete ??
